# AWS re/Start Portfolio – README

## Introduction About Me  
My name is [Your Full Name]. I come from a background where I was new to cloud computing and information technology, but I developed a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. My career goal is to become a Cloud Practitioner or Cloud Support Engineer and to work professionally with AWS services in the future.

## AWS re/Start Journey  
I joined the AWS re/Start program to gain practical cloud computing skills from the beginning. I wanted hands-on experience using AWS, to improve my technical knowledge, and to prepare myself for a career in cloud computing. Throughout the program, I have learned how cloud computing works, how to use AWS services in real labs, how to work with Linux and Python, and how to troubleshoot technical problems. I also gained experience working in teams and improving my communication skills.

## Skills and Technologies  
During the program, I gained experience using several AWS services such as EC2 for virtual servers, S3 for cloud storage, RDS for managed databases, Lambda for serverless computing, VPC for networking, and IAM for security and user management. I also developed Linux skills including file management, permissions, software installation, and basic terminal commands. In Python, I learned about variables, data types, loops, functions, and basic automation scripts. I also gained knowledge of networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnets, and routing, as well as database concepts including SQL and cloud-based databases.

## Things Completed During the Program  
Throughout the AWS re/Start program, I completed several certifications and earned badges including Security Simulearn, Networking Simulearn, Storage Simulearn, and Database Simulearn. I also completed multiple projects such as a Static Website, a 3D Architecture design, and an AWS Lex Bot project. In addition, I completed several hands-on labs covering compute, storage, networking, and databases.

## AWS Core Services Explained  

### Compute  
In AWS, compute refers to the use of servers and processing power to run applications and systems. Examples of compute services include EC2, which provides virtual machines, and Lambda, which allows code to run without managing servers. Compute is important because it allows applications to run in the cloud and scale automatically based on user demand.

### Networking  
Networking in AWS is used to connect services and resources together and to provide access to the internet. Services such as VPC create a private network in the cloud, while Route 53 is used for domain name services. Networking is important because it controls how data flows between systems and improves both security and performance.

### Storage  
Storage in AWS is used to store files, backups, and application data. S3 is used for object storage such as images, videos, and website files, while EBS provides storage for EC2 virtual machines. Storage is important because it keeps data safe, available, and easily accessible from anywhere.

### Databases  
Databases are used to store structured application data such as user information and transaction records. AWS provides database services like RDS for SQL databases and DynamoDB for NoSQL databases. Databases are important because they allow applications to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently and securely.

### Security  
Security in AWS is managed using IAM roles and policies. IAM roles give services permission to access other AWS resources, while IAM policies define what users and services are allowed to do. Encryption is also used to protect data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

## Projects  

### Static Website  
The Static Website project had a deadline of 28 November. It was hosted using Amazon S3 and CloudFront. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to host a website using AWS cloud services.

### 3D Architecture  
The 3D Architecture project had a deadline of 5 December. It was created using AWS architecture design tools. The purpose of this project was to visually show how different AWS services connect and work together.

### AWS Lex Bot  
The AWS Lex Bot project is still to be announced. It is being built using Amazon Lex. The purpose of this project is to create a chatbot that can interact with users using natural language.

## Labs  
A minimum of two labs were completed in each section, including Compute, Storage, Networking, and Databases. In the Compute labs, I created EC2 instances, connected using SSH, and installed a web server. These steps helped me understand how to launch servers, access them remotely, and manage basic server operations. In the Storage labs, I created S3 buckets, uploaded files, and configured permissions. This helped me understand how cloud storage works and how to secure stored data. In the Networking labs, I created VPCs, subnets, and attached internet gateways. These steps helped me understand how AWS resources connect and how private and public networks function. In the Database labs, I created RDS databases, connected using endpoints, and inserted test data. This helped me understand how cloud databases store and manage application data. Screenshots for each lab are stored inside the relevant lab folders with step-by-step explanations.
