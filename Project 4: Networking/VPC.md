# 🌐 Create Subnets and Allocate IP Addresses in an Amazon VPC

This repository contains my notes and steps from the **AWS VPC Subnetting Lab**, where I practiced creating a VPC, allocating subnets, and assigning IP addresses in a customer scenario.

---

## ✅ Lab Objectives

In this lab, I learned how to:

* ✔️ Summarize a customer networking scenario
* ✔️ Create an Amazon VPC using the AWS Management Console
* ✔️ Allocate private IP addresses for the VPC (~15,000 IPs)
* ✔️ Create a public subnet with at least 50 IP addresses
* ✔️ Verify and document the VPC and subnet configuration

---

## 🖥️ **Task 1: Investigate Customer Needs**

Customer request:

* Needs a VPC in the **192.x.x.x private range**
* Requires **~15,000 private IP addresses**
* Requires a **public subnet** with ≥ 50 IP addresses
* Needs basic connectivity (Internet Gateway, Public Route Table)

---

## 🗄️ **Task 2: Plan CIDR Blocks**


### 📌 VPC CIDR Block

* Requirement: ~15,000 IPs
* /18 provides 16,384 IPs → fits requirement

```
192.168.0.0/18
```

### 📌 Public Subnet CIDR Block

* Requirement: ≥ 50 IPs
* /26 provides 64 IPs → fits requirement

```
192.168.1.0/26
```

## 🛠️ **Task 3: Create the VPC**

### Step 1: Opened VPC on AWS Console

### Step 4: Created VPC

## ✅ Conclusion

I have now successfully:

* ✔️ Designed a VPC with private and public subnets
* ✔️ Allocated IP addresses based on customer requirements
* ✔️ Used AWS Management Console to create and verify VPC resources
* ✔️ Prepared a customer-friendly summary of your findings
