# AWS re/Start Portfolio 

## Introduction About Me  
My name is Lufuno Nyadzani. I hold a Diploma in Information Technology with a strong focus on Networking, Security, Cloud Computing, and Java programming. This qualification gave me a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical IT skills, especially in understanding how networks operate, how systems are secured, how cloud platforms function, and how software applications are developed. My career goal is to become a Cloud Support Engineer and to work professionally with AWS services while continuously growing my technical expertise.

## AWS re/Start Journey  
I joined the AWS re/Start program to gain practical cloud computing skills from the beginning. I wanted hands-on experience using AWS, to improve my technical knowledge, and to prepare myself for a career in cloud computing. Throughout the program, I have learned how cloud computing works, how to use AWS services in real labs, how to work with Linux and Python, and how to troubleshoot technical problems. I also gained experience working in teams and improving my communication skills.

## Skills and Technologies  
During the program, I gained experience using several AWS services such as EC2 for virtual servers, S3 for cloud storage, RDS for managed databases, Lambda for serverless computing, VPC for networking, and IAM for security and user management. I also developed Linux skills including file management, permissions, software installation, and basic terminal commands. In Python, I learned about variables, data types, loops, functions, and basic automation scripts. I also gained knowledge of networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnets, and routing, as well as database concepts including SQL and cloud-based databases.

## Things Completed During the Program  
Throughout the AWS re/Start program, I completed several certifications and earned badges including Security Simulearn, Networking Simulearn, Storage Simulearn, and Database Simulearn. I also completed multiple projects such as a Static Website, a 3D Architecture design, and an AWS Lex Bot project. In addition, I completed several hands-on labs covering compute, storage, networking, and databases.

## AWS Core Services Explained  

### Compute  
In AWS, compute refers to the use of servers and processing power to run applications and systems. Examples of compute services include EC2, which provides virtual machines, and Lambda, which allows code to run without managing servers. Compute is important because it allows applications to run in the cloud and scale automatically based on user demand.

### Networking  
Networking in AWS is used to connect services and resources together and to provide access to the internet. Services such as VPC create a private network in the cloud, while Route 53 is used for domain name services. Networking is important because it controls how data flows between systems and improves both security and performance.

### Storage  
Storage in AWS is used to store files, backups, and application data. S3 is used for object storage such as images, videos, and website files, while EBS provides storage for EC2 virtual machines. Storage is important because it keeps data safe, available, and easily accessible from anywhere.

### Databases  
Databases are used to store structured application data such as user information and transaction records. AWS provides database services like RDS for SQL databases and DynamoDB for NoSQL databases. Databases are important because they allow applications to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently and securely.

### Security  
Security in AWS is managed using IAM roles and policies. IAM roles give services permission to access other AWS resources, while IAM policies define what users and services are allowed to do. Encryption is also used to protect data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

## Projects  

### Static Website  
The Static Website project had a deadline of 28 November. It was hosted using Amazon S3 and CloudFront. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to host a website using AWS cloud services.

### 3D Architecture  
The 3D Architecture project had a deadline of 5 December. It was created using AWS architecture design tools. The purpose of this project was to visually show how different AWS services connect and work together.

### AWS Lex Bot  
The AWS Lex Bot project is still to be announced. It is being built using Amazon Lex. The purpose of this project is to create a chatbot that can interact with users using natural language.

## Labs  
[Linux Labs](https://github.com/Lufunonyadzani/-AWS_re-Start-Labs/tree/09f159f9aee321bd6c4d2b9390b19b8b7bf4f31c/Project%202%3A%20Lunix)
This lab focuses on teaching essential Bash shell and Linux command-line skills within an Amazon Linux EC2 environment. You learn how to securely connect to an EC2 instance using SSH, create useful command aliases, and perform a full folder backup using the tar utility. The project also explores how the PATH environment variable works, showing how Linux locates executables and how to add new directories to PATH so scripts can run from anywhere. By completing the tasks, you gain hands-on experience with navigation, permissions, environment variables, and basic automation—core skills needed for managing Linux servers and working effectively in cloud environments. 

[Database Labs](https://github.com/Lufunonyadzani/-AWS_re-Start-Labs/tree/a476daadda0b0a5279447734dc86dd1ce1004d38/Project%203%3A%20Database)
The lab guides you through creating a new database named world, building a table called country, and examining its structure with queries such as SHOW DATABASES, SHOW TABLES, and SHOW COLUMNS. You also learn how to correct a mistake in the table schema using the ALTER TABLE command. Additional challenges include creating a new table and working with common data types. The final part of the lab teaches how to safely delete tables and databases using the DROP command, reinforcing the importance of understanding destructive operations. 

[Networking Labs](https://github.com/Lufunonyadzani/-AWS_re-Start-Labs/tree/7a3bd122c9d4535809fa3d743f2729c961f7b9de/Project%204%3A%20Networking) This lab focuses on understanding public and private IP addressing within an AWS VPC by investigating a customer issue where one EC2 instance can access the internet while another cannot. As a cloud support engineer, I analyze the IP configuration of both instances and discover that instance A cannot reach the internet because it only has a private IP address, while instance B has a public IP that allows external connectivity and successful SSH access. 

[Python Labs](https://github.com/Lufunonyadzani/-AWS_re-Start-Labs/tree/28d468d4e4fe4cb30c67dd95a6f04277997887f4/Project%205%3A%20Python)This lab introduces you to basic programming through Python and teaches you how to create and run your first Python script using the AWS Cloud9 IDE. After launching the lab environment and opening Cloud9, you create a new Python file, save it with a .py extension, and explore the terminal to verify available Python versions. You then write a simple print("Hello, World") statement to confirm that your Python environment is working correctly. 

[Security Labs](https://github.com/Lufunonyadzani/-AWS_re-Start-Labs/tree/28d468d4e4fe4cb30c67dd95a6f04277997887f4/Project%206%3A%20Security) Security This lab teaches you how to use Amazon Inspector to automatically scan AWS Lambda functions for vulnerabilities and remediate security findings in a real-world development scenario. Acting as a cloud engineer for AnyCompany, you activate Amazon Inspector, review its dashboard, and observe how it continuously analyzes Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and Amazon ECR images for outdated or vulnerable software. You explore Inspector findings, including severity levels, impacted resources, and CVE details pulled from the National Vulnerability Database.
