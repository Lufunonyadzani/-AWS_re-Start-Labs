# Monitor an EC2 Instance Using Amazon CloudWatch & SNS

## Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates how **logging and monitoring** work together to maintain system performance and security in AWS. Using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon SNS**, an alarm is created to monitor CPU usage on an EC2 instance. When the CPU utilization exceeds a defined threshold, an email notification is automatically sent.
