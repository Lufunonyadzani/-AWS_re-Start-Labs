# Challenge Lab: Bash Shell Scripting Exercise

## Lab Overview

This challenge lab focuses on **Bash shell scripting and Linux file automation**. The goal of the lab is to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance using **SSH**, write a **Bash script that automatically generates files**, and ensure that the script dynamically continues numbering without hardcoding values.

This lab builds practical skills in:

* Remote Linux access
* Bash scripting
* File system automation
* Looping and condition handling in shell scripts
