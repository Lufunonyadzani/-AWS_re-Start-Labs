## Exercise 1: Introducing Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language used for many types of applications, including web development, automation, and data analysis.

This lab uses **Python 3.6.x**.

### Checking Installed Python Versions

Run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
python --version
python2 --version
python3 --version
```

Example output:

```text
Python 3.6.12
