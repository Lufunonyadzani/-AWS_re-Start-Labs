This course walks me through designing and building cloud‑based file storage solutions using AWS — combining a simulated customer scenario with a hands‑on lab in a real AWS environment. 

Key services and concepts covered:

* Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) — a cloud file storage service that scales automatically and supports mounting by compute resources. 
* Amazon EC2 — cloud compute instances which you can attach/mount EFS file systems to. 
* Cloud file‑storage concepts: network‑file systems, mount targets, VPC/subnet security, shared file access for multiple compute instances.

##  Skills Gained

By completing this course, I gain:

* ✅ Understanding of Cloud File Systems vs. other AWS storage types (block storage, object storage, etc.)
* ✅ Practical ability to design and implement a scalable shared file system using EFS + EC2
* ✅ Knowledge about network setup for cloud file systems (VPCs, mount targets, security groups, permissions)
* ✅ Experience working in AWS Console — building cloud infrastructure, mounting file systems, testing file access
* ✅ Insight into real‑world architecture: when to use file storage, how to permit shared access, how to secure data

## Tools, Services & Technologies Used

* Amazon EFS (for elastic, shared file storage) 
* EC2 instances (Linux-based) as clients for mounting the file system 
* AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, security groups — for secure network configuration and access control 
* AWS Management Console — to create and configure EFS file systems, mount targets, and instances
