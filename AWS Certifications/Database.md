![Database_page-0001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a84901b8-dae9-450e-901a-5185dbdff499)

##  Overview

**AWS SimuLearn: Databases in Practice** is an immersive, scenario-based learning experience from AWS Skill Builder. I engage with simulated customer conversations powered by generative AI to gather requirements, design AWS database solutions, and then I implement those solutions in a safe AWS environment. 


##  Purpose

The goal of this exercise was to:

1. **Understand real-world database requirements** by interacting with a simulated customer.
2. **Select appropriate AWS database services** to meet specified performance, scalability, cost, and consistency needs.
3. **Design database architectures** using AWS services.
4. **Deploy and validate the solution** in an AWS environment.
5. **Reflect on architectural choices** and apply best practices.

## Key Concepts Covered

* AWS Database types and services (relational, NoSQL, key-value, document, graph, time-series)
* Data modeling trade-offs (consistency vs. performance vs. scalability)
* Customer requirement analysis and solution recommendation
* Hands-on implementation of database services
* Validation of solution correctness and performance
