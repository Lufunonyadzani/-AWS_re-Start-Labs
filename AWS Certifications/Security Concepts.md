**What the course is about:**
This course teaches core AWS cloud security fundamentals through interactive, real‑world scenario simulations and hands‑on labs. I design and implement secure AWS solutions in a live AWS Console environment based on guided scenarios. 

Key security services covered include, but are not limited to:

* Identity & Access Management (IAM) for user, role and permissions management 
* Working with compute and database services like EC2 and RDS, with a security‑first perspective.

## Learning Outcomes / Key Skills Gained

After completing the course, I should gain:

* ✅ Solid understanding of AWS security fundamentals (access control, identity management) 
* ✅ Ability to design secure architectures on AWS including secure compute/database setup using EC2/RDS with proper IAM permissions
* ✅ Practical experience implementing security controls and following best practices for cloud security on AWS 
* ✅ Hands‑on exposure to security workflows and AWS tools for protecting cloud resources

## 🛠️ Typical Course Structure & Activities

* Interactive simulation where you design a security solution for a fictional customer scenario.
* Guided lab in a live AWS Console where you build and implement the proposed solution. 
* Focus on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), compute/data services (EC2, RDS), and secure configurations.

## Why This Course Matters

* Cloud security is essential — this course builds foundational AWS security knowledge.
* It helps one to understand AWS’s identity & access model and how to secure compute and data services properly.
* Good baseline if you later go for more advanced AWS security certifications or real‑world AWS architecture projects.
