# Using Amazon Inspector for Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation

##  Lab Overview

In this lab, I use **Amazon Inspector** to scan AWS resources—specifically **AWS Lambda functions**—for security vulnerabilities. I activated the service, review findings, and remediate detected issues.

The development team at **AnyCompany** is building an application using AWS Lambda and needs an automated tool that scans for vulnerable software packages and insecure code. Amazon Inspector fits this requirement by:

* Continuously scanning Lambda functions after each deployment
* Automatically scanning EC2 instances and Amazon ECR images
* Providing detailed vulnerability insights and remediation steps

---

##  Objectives

After completing this lab, I will be able to:

*  Activate **Amazon Inspector**
*  Analyze and interpret vulnerability findings
*  Remediate vulnerabilities in AWS Lambda functions
